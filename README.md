Blends for pak128.Britain-Ex, part of the Simutrans project - see https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/board,75.0.html

# Licence - Blends
The files in this repository are largely derivatives of artwork in [James Petts' repository](https://github.com/jamespetts/Pak128.Britain-blends), which were originally created for pak128.Britain. The vast majority of the .blends there have been placed in the public domain by posts in [the relevant subforum of the International Simutrans Forum](https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/board,51.0.html). WLindley has done so [here](https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php?msg=39413). Unfortunately, the forum search is currently (2020) broken, so I can't point you to all of the other posts yet. These Blender files are used to generate .png files, which are combined with their associated .dat files to generate the .pak files used by Simutrans. The pak128.Britain(-Ex) paksets are released under [the Artistic Licence 1.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0). For the purposes of that licence, I think the pngs and dats are the source, the paksets are the output and the Standard Version can be found in [James Petts' pak128.Britain repository](https://github.com/jamespetts/simutrans-pak128.britain). If so, then the .blend files are not covered by the AL. But I am not a lawyer.

A few of the .blend files contain elements from BlendSwap that carry more specific attribution requirements under a [CC-BY licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) (see [this forum discussion](https://forum.simutrans.com/index.php/topic,19042.0.html), though it is now outdated) . Those attributions are placed in the .dat files, which may be here or may be in [my pakset repository](https://github.com/MatthewForrester/simutrans-pak128.britain).

My original work and modifications are all placed in the public domain, unless they are restricted according to the two paragraphs above.
